MultiMT is a project led by [Prof. Lucia Specia](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/L.Specia/), funded by an ERC (European Research Council) Starting Grant. The aim of the project is to devise data, methods and algorithms to exploit multi-modal information (images, speech, metadata etc.) for context modelling in Machine Translation and other crosslingual and multilingual tasks. The project is highly interdisciplinary, drawing upon different research fields as such NLP, Computer Vision, Speech Processing and Machine Learning.
